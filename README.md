# _Instacracker_

Instacracker is a instagram password cracker that uses tor as a proxy.

### How to use it:

*	Configure your torrc. Read the [stem faq](https://stem.torproject.org/faq.html) to understand what it means.
*	Add your password to the script
*	run a tor
*	run the script with its arguments (-t \<number of threads>, -u \<user name>, -f \<wordlist>)
*	Wait

### Is it stable?

Not as much as a would like ;)

### Does it work?

Tests were ran with 1000 wrong passwords and the 1001th was the right one and it worked.

### How long does it takes to break a password

A lot of time (sorry about that)
